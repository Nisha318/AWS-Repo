Looking for an applied example of host hardening in the cloud?  
Check out my [STIG-Hardened RHEL 9 Server in AWS](https://github.com/yourusername/stig-hardened-rhel9-aws) project.  

It demonstrates:  
- Deploying a RHEL 9 EC2 instance in AWS  
- Applying DISA STIGs manually and with Ansible + OpenSCAP  
- Validating compliance with STIG Viewer  
- Mapping to RMF controls (SI-2, SC-28, AC-2)  

This project ties together AWS infrastructure security and RMF compliance.
