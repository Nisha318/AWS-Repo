## Next Steps
While the current solution works end-to-end, there are clear opportunities for improvement that align with production best practices:

1. **Amazon SES with Validated Domain**  
   - Move from Gmail integration to a verified domain email identity.  
   - Benefits: Improved deliverability, domain reputation, and professional trust.  

2. **Secure Admin Page (contacts.html)**  
   - Add IAM-based authentication or Cognito for role-based access.  
   - Ensures only authorized users can view stored leads.  

3. **Input Validation & Rate Limiting**  
   - Add more robust server-side validation in Lambda functions.  
   - Configure API Gateway usage plans and throttling to prevent abuse.  

4. **Monitoring & Alerts**  
   - Extend CloudWatch with metrics and alarms for failed Lambda executions or SES delivery failures.  
   - Optionally integrate with SNS for real-time alerts.  

5. **Analytics & Reporting**  
   - Add query and reporting features to analyze lead trends.  
   - Could connect DynamoDB data to QuickSight dashboards.  

By implementing these next steps, the solution evolves from a working prototype to a production-grade system that is secure, reliable, and enterprise-ready.
