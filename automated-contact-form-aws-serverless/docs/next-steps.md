# Next Steps: Enhancements & Hardening

This project demonstrates a working serverless contact form automation pipeline using AWS.  
The following steps are planned to improve security, reliability, and production readiness.

---

## 1. Amazon SES: Domain Validation
- **Current State:** Emails are routed via SES to a Gmail account.  
- **Improvement:** Switch to SES with a fully validated domain identity.  
- **Benefit:** Improves deliverability, ensures DMARC/DKIM/SPF alignment, and removes Gmail dependency.  

---

## 2. Secure Admin Access
- **Current State:** `contacts.html` (lead listing page) is public.  
- **Improvement:** Restrict access to authorized users via:
  - API Gateway IAM authorizers, or  
  - Amazon Cognito User Pools, or  
  - Simple IAM-based API keys.  
- **Benefit:** Protects lead data from unauthorized viewing.  

---

## 3. Enhanced Monitoring & Alerts
- **Improvement:**
  - Set up CloudWatch alarms on Lambda errors and DynamoDB throttles.  
  - Add logging dashboards for real-time visibility.  
- **Benefit:** Ensures faster detection of failures and better operational awareness.  

---

## 4. Data Retention & Analytics
- **Improvement:**
  - Define DynamoDB TTLs to auto-expire stale leads.  
  - Stream DynamoDB changes to Amazon S3 or Redshift for long-term analytics.  
- **Benefit:** Keeps the table lean, supports business insights, and reduces costs.  

---

## 5. CI/CD Automation
- **Improvement:** Implement AWS CodePipeline (or GitHub Actions) to:
  - Deploy Lambdas automatically on commit.  
  - Sync static site updates to S3.  
- **Benefit:** Reduces manual deployments, enforces Infrastructure as Code.  

---

## 6. Security Hardening
- **Improvement:**
  - Use IAM least-privilege roles for Lambda functions.  
  - Add WAF rules on API Gateway to block common attacks.  
  - Enable encryption at rest for DynamoDB (default) and enforce HTTPS for all endpoints.  
- **Benefit:** Aligns with AWS security best practices and compliance standards.  

---

## 7. Future Features
- **Optional Additions:**
  - Auto-respond to form submissions with a confirmation email.  
  - Integrate with CRM tools (e.g., Salesforce or HubSpot) via Lambda connectors.  
  - Add reCAPTCHA for spam protection.  

---

## Summary
This project is production-ready for small-scale use but will benefit from these enhancements to meet enterprise-grade requirements.  
The next steps focus on **security, scalability, automation, and integration**.
