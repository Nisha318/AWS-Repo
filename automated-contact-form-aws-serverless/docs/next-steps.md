# Next Steps: Enhancements & Hardening

This project already automates contact form handling using AWS serverless services.  
The following steps will improve reliability, usability, and scale for real-world use.

---

## 1. Amazon SES: Domain Validation
- **Current State:** Emails route to Gmail through SES.  
- **Next Step:** Move to SES with a validated domain identity (DKIM/SPF/DMARC).  
- **Value:** Improves trust and email deliverability for customer communications.  

---

## 2. Secure Admin Access
- **Current State:** Leads page is public.  
- **Next Step:** Restrict access (Cognito, IAM auth, or API keys).  
- **Value:** Ensures only the business team can view customer submissions.  

---

## 3. Monitoring & Alerts
- **Next Step:** Add CloudWatch alarms and dashboards.  
- **Value:** Gives visibility into errors or failed submissions so no lead is lost.  

---

## 4. Data Retention & Analytics
- **Next Step:** Add DynamoDB TTLs and pipe old leads to S3 for reporting.  
- **Value:** Keeps data fresh, supports long-term insights, and reduces storage costs.  

---

## 5. CI/CD Automation
- **Next Step:** Automate Lambda and static site deployments via CodePipeline or GitHub Actions.  
- **Value:** Speeds up delivery, reduces manual errors, and supports continuous improvement.

## 6. Future Features
- Auto-respond to customers with a confirmation email.  
- Add CRM integration (Salesforce, HubSpot).  
- Implement reCAPTCHA to reduce spam.
