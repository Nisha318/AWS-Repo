## üìå Purpose

This document maps the controls implemented in the **AWS Organizations: Multi-Account Governance Lab**  
to their corresponding **NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5** control families and **DoD RMF CCIs**.

This mapping shows how multi-account architecture, role-based access, and centralized audit logging  
contribute to RMF compliance requirements.

## üìé Notes

- This mapping is for educational and demonstration purposes only.  
- It is **not** part of a formal RMF authorization package.  
- Additional controls (e.g., SC, CM, CP families) may be applied in future iterations of this lab.
